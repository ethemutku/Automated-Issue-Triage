"Automated Issue Assignment: Results and Insights from an Industrial Case".

compare_algorithms.ipynb is the script for comparing different machine learning algorithms for issue report classification (Appendix A: Evaluating Existing Issue Assignment Approaches).

evaluate_time_and_amount.ipynb is for the evaluation of the results with varying time interval and amount of training data (Appendix B: Time Locality and Amount of Training Data). 

explain_issues.ipynb is the script to explain specific test issue records. (Section 5 Explaining Team Assignments)  

monitor_performance.ipynb is the script to monitor the performance of the issue assignment system. (Section 6 Monitoring Deterioration)
